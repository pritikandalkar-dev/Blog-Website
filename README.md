## Lessons Learned

#### What I Learned

While building Foodiee, I learned:

#### Challenges and How I Overcame Them

1. Challenge: Storing and displaying user comments dynamically.
Solution: Learned how to structure objects in local storage and update the DOM when a new comment is added.

2. Challenge: Keeping the design responsive across devices.
Solution: Used Bootstrap’s grid system, flex layouts, and media queries to ensure mobile-friendliness.

3. Challenge: Managing multiple recipe cards and view details functionality.
